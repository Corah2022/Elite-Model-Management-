             <p>We are always looking for new faces/new looks. If you believe you have the necessary skills and physical characteristics, please feel free to submit your application.</p> 
             <p>We will do a first screening based on the information supplied by you and, should we deem it interesting to go further, we will propose you a meeting in our offices. Please consider that, in case you are under the age of 18, your application must be approved by your parents/legal guardian. We will not be in a position to consider your application, unless we receive your parental/legal guardian’s approval. This is why we ask you to provide us with an email address, telephone number and other data of your parent/legal guardian. In case of his/her refusal, or in the event the approval is not granted within 15 days from our request, we will delete all the data supplied by you in the application. Please remember that your parent/legal guardian contact information will be the only ones we will utilise, should we intend to contact you to propose a meeting. Please also remember that we will require that your parent/legal guardian attend any meeting we might propose to you in the future.</p> 
             <p>We will utilise the information, the photographs and the personal data provided by you for the sole scope of a preliminary evaluation of your potential as a model. It is important you give us true and complete information in order to allow us to do such an evaluation. In particular, please verify you are legally in a position to provide us with the photos you are annexing herewith and that no third party (the photographer or others) may object to this.</p> 
             <p>Your personal data will be stored in the EU and will be treated electronically or physically for the purposes indicated above. The storage and the treatment of your data will last for the period that is reasonably necessary in order to do the evaluation described above.</p>

Unless and until the Booking Confirmation Form is signed by the client, all negotiations relating to the booking of the model are subject to contract. The failure to sign and/or return the signed Booking Confirmation Form whilst proceeding with the booking will be deemed to be an acceptance by the client of these terms and conditions and they shall apply to, and govern the booking between the Agency and/or the models (as relevant) and the client. Any amendment and/or variations made to the booking confirmation form by the client shall not be valid and binding unless the Agency and/or the model (as the case may be) has agreed to such amendment and/or variation in writing in advance and signed the Booking Confirmation Form after the amendment and/or variation has been included on the Booking Confirmation Form. In the event of any inconsistency or contradiction between these terms and conditions herein and the Booking Confirmation Form, the Booking Confirmation Form shall prevail.</li>\n   <li>\n      Booking fees\n      <ol type=\"1\">\n         <li>Permitted use<br>Unless agreed otherwise and included on the Booking Confirmation Form, booking fees provide an entitlement and right for the client to use one image via a single published medium for one year or for a single season in the case of a fashion booking from the date of the booking, whichever is the shortest, in the United Kingdom only. Please note that such permitted use and entitlement is strictly subject to payment in full of all fees owed to the model or the Agency prior to the image’s first use.</li>\n         <li>Working hours and Overtime<br>Fees are charged by the day or by the hour. A ‘day’ is an 8-hour period (including one hour for lunch) between 9am and 6pm (e.g. 9am-5pm or 10am-6pm). An extra hour between 9am and 6pm is charged at the model normal hourly rate. Overtime is charged on weekdays and Saturdays before 9am and after 6pm, at one-and-a half times the hourly rate. Sundays or UK Bank Holidays are charged at double the hourly rate. Any overtime which is over 5 hours will be charged at the day rate as set out in the Booking Confirmation Form.</li>\n         <li>Travel<br>Any time spent by the model travelling to or from a client’s venue will be charged at half the hourly rate. This applies to any travel outside of a five-mile radius of Hyde Park Corner (i.e. Chiswick in the west, Golders Green and Highgate Village in the north, Mile End in the east, Streatham Hill and Tooting Bec in the south).</li>\n         <li>Fitting fees<br>Any time spent by the model for fittings is charged to the client at £90 per hour (plus VAT if applicable).

If a model on location is prevented from returning to London after the booking to work, half the daily fee will be charged to, and payable by the client for each day that the model is unable to return to London to work.</li>\n               <li>When a location booking is made, the client will make a health and safety assessment of the location and shall notify the Agency of any potential risks and how these have been mitigated.

For the avoidance of doubt, additional fees are payable for the right to the additional use the Model's Image whether alone or in conjunction with any wording or other images, photographs, drawings online or in any digital media including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, Flickr, Blogs or other social networking websites or media. Unless otherwise agreed, the additional fees cover the right to use one image for one additional year from the date of booking, in the United Kingdom only, for the permitted use or uses or purposes agreed between the Agency or the model and the client. Under no circumstances will each additional usage fee be less than the model's advertised day rate as determined by the Agency unless determined otherwise by the Agency in its absolute discretion.<br>For the avoidance of doubt, any grant of rights excludes any and all, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, NFT, CGI avatars, digital characters, simulated likeness, or related virtual/augmented usage.</li>\n         <li>Territory<br>Additional fees are also payable, and subject always to the Agency’s or model’s prior consent, for the right to use the model's image or reproductions etc, as set out in section 3.1 above for all known or anticipated territories other than the United Kingdom. Unless otherwise agreed, the additional fees cover the right to use one image for one year or one season, whichever is the shortest period, unless otherwise determined by the Agency at the date of booking and/or detailed on the Booking Confirmation Form, from the date of booking, in the territory or territories agreed and stipulated on the Booking Confirmation Form. Under no circumstances will each usage fee be less than the model's advertised day rate as determined by the Agency unless determined otherwise by the Agency in its absolute discretion.</li>\n         <li>Other services<br>Additional fees are also payable for other services to be supplied by the model, for example, personal appearances for PR purposes. Fees for such services will be negotiated on a case by case basis between the client and the Agency.</li>\n      </ol>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n      Fees\n      <ol type=\"1\">\n         <li>All fees will be invoiced by the Agency.</li>\n         <li>Value added tax (VAT)<br>All sums payable under these terms and conditions are exclusive of VAT and any other similar or equivalent taxes or duties which shall be payable in full without set off by the client.</li>\n      </ol>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n      Invoicing\n      <ol type=\"1\">\n         <li>On all invoices payment is required to be made by the client within 30 days of the date of the invoice. In all cases, the person booking the model is the client, who will be invoiced and solely responsible for payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing at the time of booking. The Agency reserves the right in its discretion to invoice the 'ultimate client', (eg. designer/ manufacturer/owner of the product in question). For example, this may be done if the client is booking on behalf of the ultimate client, in which case the client and the ultimate client are jointly and severally liable to pay all of the fees and settle the invoice accordingly.

For the avoidance of doubt, additional fees are payable for the right to the additional use the Model's Image whether alone or in conjunction with any wording or other images, photographs, drawings online or in any digital media including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, Flickr, Blogs or other social networking websites or media. Unless otherwise agreed, the additional fees cover the right to use one image for one additional year from the date of booking, in the United Kingdom only, for the permitted use or uses or purposes agreed between the Agency or the model and the client. Under no circumstances will each additional usage fee be less than the model's advertised day rate as determined by the Agency unless determined otherwise by the Agency in its absolute discretion.<br>For the avoidance of doubt, any grant of rights excludes any and all, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, NFT, CGI avatars, digital characters, simulated likeness, or related virtual/augmented usage.</li>\n         <li>Territory<br>Additional fees are also payable, and subject always to the Agency’s or model’s prior consent, for the right to use the model's image or reproductions etc, as set out in section 3.1 above for all known or anticipated territories other than the United Kingdom.

In all cases, the person booking the model is the client, who will be invoiced and solely responsible for payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing at the time of booking. The Agency reserves the right in its discretion to invoice the 'ultimate client', (eg. designer/ manufacturer/owner of the product in question). For example, this may be done if the client is booking on behalf of the ultimate client, in which case the client and the ultimate client are jointly and severally liable to pay all of the fees and settle the invoice accordingly. All fees for usage are for the right to use the model's image and, once agreed, are payable whether or not the right is exercised.

A model can supply services to and allow use of the model's image by any competitor unless such an exclusivity fee is negotiated and paid by the client. It is the client's responsibility to carry out any research and check whether the model supplied has undertaken or is booked to undertake any conflicting work.</li>\n      </ol>\n   </li>\n   <li>Provisional bookings<br>Provisional bookings will be automatically cancelled if they are not confirmed by the client (by signing and returning the Booking Confirmation Form) within 24 hours of the proposed booking.</li>\n   <li>\n      Cancellations\n      <ol type=\"1\">\n         <li>\n            Cancellation of booking by the client\n            <ol type=\"1\">\n               <li>Within 24 hours of the booking call time the full booking fee will be charged and payable by the client unless the same model is booked within 24 hours of the cancellation in which case half the booking fee will be charged and payable by the client.</li>\n               <li>Outside 24 hours of the booking call time but within 48 hours of the booking call time of the booking date then half the booking fee will be charged and payable by the client.</li>\n               <li>The full booking fee will be charged and payable by the client for bookings of more than three days duration cancelled within a period equal to or less than the length of the booking.
